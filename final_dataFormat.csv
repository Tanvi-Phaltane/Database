The  STZ treated  animals  reported a  decrease  in  hepatic  glycogen content  which  may  be  due  to  an  increased  glucose. The elevation of serum insulin in STZ diabetic rats could either  be  due  to  the  insulinotropic  substances  present  in the fractions, which induce the in intact functional beta-cells to produce insulin, or the protection of the functional ?-cells from  further  deterioration  so  that  they  remain  active  and produce insulin.",Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats,-,800 mg/kg,"http://impactfactor.org/PDF/IJPPR/8/IJPPR,Vol8,Issue3,Article14.pdf",Mixture
